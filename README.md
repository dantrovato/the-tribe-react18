Marketing campaign
Create a compelling website: Enhance your existing website by showcasing the unique selling points of your group, such as attractive and in-shape attendees. Provide information about upcoming events, testimonials from previous attendees, and a clear call-to-action to join the group or RSVP for parties.

Social media marketing: Leverage popular social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook to reach a wider audience. Create engaging content related to your parties, share attractive photos, and use appropriate hashtags to increase visibility. Consider partnering with influencers or lifestyle bloggers who align with your target audience.

Email marketing: Build an email list by offering a newsletter or exclusive updates about upcoming events. Send regular newsletters with valuable content, party announcements, special offers, and exclusive discounts to entice subscribers and keep them engaged.

Event listing websites: Besides Meetup.com and Fetlife, explore other event listing platforms specific to your niche. Look for local directories, lifestyle websites, or online communities where you can promote your parties to reach interested individuals.

Collaborations and partnerships: Seek collaborations with other lifestyle or adult-oriented businesses that share a similar target audience. This can include local clubs, adult stores, photographers, or DJs. Cross-promote each other's services and offer special deals or joint events to attract a wider audience.

Offline promotion: Consider distributing flyers or promotional materials in adult-oriented establishments, lifestyle clubs, and relevant venues. Ensure your promotional materials are visually appealing and include key information about your parties, website, and contact details.

Word-of-mouth marketing: Encourage your existing attendees to invite like-minded friends or acquaintances to the parties. Offer referral incentives or discounts for bringing new attendees, as positive word-of-mouth can be highly effective in growing your community.
