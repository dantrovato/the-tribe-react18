      <p className="mb-4">Q - Can you tell me more about the parties?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A - Before the party you'll have the option to be added to a WhatsApp
        group with all the other guests so you can get to know each other and
        flirt a bit. These groups get pingy so you may want to mute the chat.
        Nude pictures flow freely, here, so be aware of that. At the bigger
        events most people will mostly know one another. If you're a complete
        newbie, chances are you will be at one of the smaller introductory
        events. People will just chill and chat over drinks for a while and, at
        some point, surely, somebody will start playing and more and more people
        will then join in, separately or otherwise. It's all super friendly and
        free flowing. Remember that there is never any pressure to join in and
        if you're uncomfortable at any point, do speak to anyone wearing a
        flashing blue armband. The 'generals' are there to make your night as
        amazing as it can be. Please read the rules outlined below
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">Q - What do you do about sexual health safety?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A - If you'd like to receive a wristband to indicate a recent clean
        sexual health result, please find one of our "generals" (people with a
        flashy blue armband) and show them your most recent test. You'll be
        given a wristband corresponding to the length of time that has passed
        since the date of the test. For example, if your test was done within
        the month, you will receive a blue wristband (the colours are change
        from party to particularly). If it was done within the last two months,
        you will receive a green wristband. If it was done within the last three
        months, you will receive a yellow wristband. If it was done within the
        last two months, you will receive an orange wristband. If the test
        results are incomplete (urine only - for example) the wristband is a
        grey one.
        <br />
        We don't tell grown-up people what to do with their naughty bits but we
        discourage anyone from having oral, unprotected sex with individuals
        without a wristband. Even with a blue wristband, we urge guests to have
        an open conversation about the number of partners they have had since
        their last clear test results. We believe this system is a significant
        step forward in safeguarding the sexual health of our community, but it
        is not a foolproof solution, and personal responsibility must be
        exercised. For instance, engaging in unprotected oral sex with someone
        you just met at a sex party still carries its risks. Please help us keep
        the community safe by being extra careful.

      <p className="mb-4">Q - Am I expected to participate?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A - No. Never. You can just come and make friends.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Q - What kind of people attend and what age group are they?
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A - We aim at a 50/50 male to female ratio but that varies from party to
        party. The age bracket tends to range from early 20s to late 30s.
