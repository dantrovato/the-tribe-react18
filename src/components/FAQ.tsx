      <p className="mb-4">Q - Can you tell me more about the parties?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A - Before the party you'll have the option to be added to a WhatsApp
        group with all the other guests so you can get to know each other and
        flirt a bit. These groups get pingy so you may want to mute the chat.
        Nude pictures flow freely, here, so be aware of that. At the bigger
        events most people will mostly know one another. If you're a complete
        newbie, chances are you will be at one of the smaller introductory
        events. People will just chill and chat over drinks for a while and, at
        some point, surely, somebody will start playing and more and more people
        will then join in, separately or otherwise. It's all super friendly and
        free flowing. Remember that there is never any pressure to join in and
        if you're uncomfortable at any point, do speak to anyone wearing a
        flashing blue armband. The 'generals' are there to make your night as
        amazing as it can be. Please read the rules outlined below

      <p className="mb-4">Q - What do you do about sexual health safety?</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A - Upon arrival, you'll be asked to show your most recent negative
        sexual health results. You'll be given a wristband corresponding to the
        length of time that has passed since the date of the test. For example,
        if your test was done within the last two weeks, you will receive a blue
        wristband. If it was done within the last month, you will receive a
        green wristband. If it was done within the last six weeks, you will
        receive a yellow wristband. If it was done within the last two months,
        you will receive an orange wristband. Beyond two months, you will get a
        slightly judgy frown and no wristband. We don't tell grown-up people
        what to do with their naughty bits but we strongly discourage anyone
        from having sex with individuals without a wristband. Even with a blue
        wristband, we urge guests to have an open conversation about the number
        of partners they have had since their last clear test results. We
        believe this system is a significant step forward in safeguarding the
        sexual health of our community, but it is not a foolproof solution, and
        personal responsibility must be exercised. For instance, engaging in
        unprotected oral sex with someone you just met at a sex party still
        carries its risks. Please help us keep the community safe by being extra
        careful.
