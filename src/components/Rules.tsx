      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>
        At the bigger events most people will know one another. If you're a
        complete newbie, chances are you will be at one of the smaller
        introductory events. People will just chill and chat and at some point,
        surely, somebody will start playing and more and more people will then
        join in, separately or otherwise. Remember that there is never any
        pressure to join in and if you're uncomfortable at any point, do speak
        to anyone wearing a flashing blue armband. The 'generals' are there to
        make your night as amazing as it can be. Please read the rules outlined
        below
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 1</h2>
      <h3>Consent!</h3>
      <p>
        DO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU ARE GONNA TOUCH SOMEBODY THEY ARE more “yay”
        than “eeeewww”. At a minimum you must be able to read body language but
        verbally asking is even better.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 2</h2>
      <h3>Know your boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re on the receiving end of unwanted attention you also share the
        responsibility of making sure that stops. If somebody puts a hand on
        your hip and you don’t like it, make sure you say it. Or at the very
        least lean back. They shouldn’t do that but it’s also on you to let them
        know. It’s no good to go with the flow only to regret it the next day.
        No good to you and no good to the person who’s gonna get accused of
        sexual misconduct. That’s not fair. Best thing to do is to think, in
        advance, of a polite way to say no, you can just say “I need a bit of a
        break”. But the more niche “you’re ruining my chi” and “I think you’re
        being ambitious” work too.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 3</h2>
      <h3>No default BDSM mode</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re playing with somebody don’t assume you know what they’re into.
        Not everyone likes to be spanked, choked or getting jizzed on the face.
        I particularly hate the latter!
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 4</h2>
      <h3>Bin your condoms</h3>
      <p>For the love of god...</p>
      <h2>Rule # 5</h2>
      <h3>Stealthing</h3>
      <p>
        This one hardly needs mentioning but better say it and not need it than
        the opposite. Anyone caught removing their johnny without their partner
        knowing will be decapitated. Also, do remember to change condoms every
        time a penis or toy goes from one body to another.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 6</h2>
      <h3>No Piggybacking</h3>
      <p>
        If you see two or more people having sex don’t just jump in. It’s really
        awkward to have to shoo someone away. If you are not a regular play
        partner with whoever is in the scrum wait to be invited in.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 7</h2>
      <h3>No Squirting</h3>
      <p>
        All you plumbers out there, there are way too many people for this. No
        need to show off. We know you are familiar with the female anatomy but
        nobody wants to be finding a free surface and then have to sit on a wet
        patch.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 8</h2>
      <h3>No drinks in the play areas</h3>
      <p>It's just a mess waiting to happen.</p>
    </div>
