          Sexual Health Safety

        <h3 className="text-muted text-center pb-3">The wristband system:</h3>
        <p className="text-muted p-3">
          As a community we value sexual health and safety. We encourage
          everyone to get tested regularly, especially ahead of the parties.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whilst it would be great if everyone were to have a conversation about
          their sexual health before playing, we understand that this is not
          always gonna happen. Especially when spontaneity takes over.
          <br />
          <br />
          To make this smoother, we have introduced the wristband system;
          <br />
          <br /> Upon arrival, you can choose to present your most recent sexual
          health test results to the person greeting you at the door.
          <br />
          You will then get a wristband of a colour that indicates the recency
          of your test; one, two or three months.
          <br />
          <br /> If you don't have recent test results, it's okay; not everyone
          does. Just have a chat about your recent sexual history with the
          person/people you are going to play with.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whilst the wristband system offers some reassurance and encourages
          people into getting tested regularly, it is not foolproof. Personal
          responsibility remains essential. Your cooperation is vital in
          maintaining a safe community.

      <h2>Rule # 1</h2>
      <h3>Enthusiastic consent!</h3>
      <p>
        Do not touch anybody sexually without first receiving clear,
        enthusiastic consent. This applies to people you have played with in the
        past. Things change quickly in the community and just because somebody
        was happy to play with you at one stage doesn't mean they want to play
        with you now.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 2</h2>
      <h3>Know your boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        Consent is everything. If someone crosses your boundaries, you have
        every right to let them know—and we encourage you to do so. If someone
        touches your hip and you don’t like it, it's completely okay to speak up
        or give a clear non-verbal signal.
        <br />
        While no one should ever overstep, staying silent or freezing in the
        moment can sometimes be misinterpreted. You never have to go along with
        something you’re unsure about, and setting clear boundaries in the
        moment protects both you and those around you.
        <br />
        We understand that some people may struggle with freezing in certain
        situations, and we have nothing but empathy and support for that.
        However, in an environment like this, where open, enthusiastic
        communication is key, expressing your limits is completely normal.
        Although it's incredibly unlikely an event may occur, we highly
        recommend you prepare yourself for giving a verbal signal by practising
        what you might say. If this feels difficult or overwhelming, we
        completely understand, but then events of this kind might not be the
        best fit for you.
        <br />
        That said, these are warm, welcoming spaces, and you’re never alone. Our
        "Generals" (easily spotted in blue armbands) are always on hand to
        ensure that everyone feels safe and respected. At the end of the day,
        we’re all here to have a good time—let’s make sure it’s a great one for
        everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Rule # 3</h2>
      <h3>No default BDSM mode</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re playing with somebody don’t assume you know what they’re into.
        Not everyone likes to be spanked, choked or getting jizzed on the face.
        I particularly hate the latter!
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 4</h2>
      <h3>Bin your condoms</h3>
      <p>For the love of god...</p>
      <h2>Rule # 5</h2>
      <h3>Stealthing</h3>
      <p>
        This one hardly needs mentioning but better say it and not need it than
        the opposite. Anyone caught removing their johnny without their partner
        knowing will be decapitated. Also, do remember to change condoms every
        time a penis or toy goes from one body to another.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 6</h2>
      <h3>No Piggybacking</h3>
      <p>
        If you see two or more people having sex don’t just jump in. It’s really
        awkward to have to shoo someone away. If you are not a regular play
        partner with whoever is in the scrum wait to be invited in.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 7</h2>
      <h3>Give space</h3>
      <p>
        If you see two or more people having sex don’t invade their space by
        staring too closely. Like the no piggybacking rule, it's awkward to have
        to shoo someone away. You can respectfully look at people have fun but
        give them plenty of space or you'll get asked to back off.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 8</h2>
      <h3>No squirting</h3>
      <p>
        All you plumbers out there, there are way too many people for this. No
        need to show off. We know you are familiar with the female anatomy but
        nobody wants to be finding a free surface and then have to sit on a wet
        patch.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 9</h2>
      <h3>No drinks, chewing gum, shoes, phones in the play areas</h3>
      <p>Your things will be waiting for you when you come out.</p>
      <h2>Rule # 10</h2>
      <h3>Don't get too drunk</h3>
      <p>If you're not sober enough you won't be let into the play areas.</p>
      <h2>Rule # 11</h2>
      <h3>
        No DMs to anybody in the what's app chat until you asked them in the
        chat first
      </h3>
      <p>
        Girls especially can get inundated with unwanted messages. Just ask in
        the chat if you can message them privately.
