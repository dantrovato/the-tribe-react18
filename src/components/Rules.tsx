        <h3 className="text-danger text-center pb-3">The wristband system:</h3>
        <p className="text-danger p-3">
          While you don't have to have a recent sexual health result to attend
          the party, we recommend that you do. We also recommend having a
          conversation about your sexual health with whomever you're about to
          play with. Sometimes, it's inconvenient to do so, especially when
          engaging with someone quite spontaneously. To make this smoother, we
          have introduced the wristband system.
          <br /> Upon arrival, you can opitonally present your recent sexual
          health test results. Based on the date of your test, you will receive
          a wristband of a color that indicates the recency of your test:
          <br />
          <br />- Green wristband (for example) for tests taken within the last
          month.
          <br />- Yellow wristband for tests taken within the last two months.
          <br />- Orange wristband for tests taken within the last three months.
          <br />- Grey wristband for partial test results.
          <br />
          <br /> (The colours will change from party to party)
          <br />
          <br /> No wristband provided for tests that are more than three months
          old.
          <br />
          <br /> If you do not have recent test results, it's okay; not everyone
          does. We encourage open discussions about your recent sexual history
          and the reasons for not having a wristband. While we respect personal
          choices, we discourage unprotected oral sex with individuals lacking a
          wristband. Even with a wristband, we urge guests to avoid unprotected
          intercourse and openly communicate about their sexual history since
          their last clear test results. While this system enhances the sexual
          health safety of our community, it is not foolproof, and personal
          responsibility remains essential. The wristband system serves as a
          quick way to know when somebody got tested. Engaging in unprotected
          oral sex with someone you just met at the event still carries risks,
          as does kissing, apparently (goddamn it!). Your cooperation is vital
          in maintaining a safe community.

      <h2>Rule # 1</h2>
      <h3>Enthusiastic consent!</h3>
      <p>
        Do not touch anybody sexually without first receiving clear,
        enthusiastic consent. This applies to people you have played with in the
        past. Things change quickly in the community and just because somebody
        was happy to play with you at one stage doesn't mean they want to play
        with you now.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 2</h2>
      <h3>Know your boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        This is apparently our most controversial rule; we think that if
        somebody breaks the above rule about consent you should tell them!
        Whoa... <br />
        If somebody puts a hand on your hip and you don’t like it, make sure you
        say it. Or at the very least give a non verbal sign. They should never
        do that but if you just freeze this could be taken as a green light. DO
        NOT go with the flow only to regret it the next day. No good to you and
        no good to the person who’s gonna get accused of sexual misconduct. Best
        thing to do is to think, in advance, of a polite way to say no. You can
        just say “I need a bit of a break” or "maybe later". But the more direct
        “No, thank you” works too. Let's just keep it polite. <br />A handful of
        people have criticised this rule because they see it as potentially
        "blaming the victim". We politely reject their hypothesis. Instead, we
        feel this adds an extra layer of protection, ensuring there will never
        be a victim. These are super friendly parties and the chance of anybody
        being threatening to you is absolute zero. Should that happen, however,
        our "generals" will be on hand to deal with the situation. You'll know
        who they are as they will be wearing a flashy blue armband. <br />
        If having read the above you still fear you may be unable to follow this
        rule this party, sadly, may not be for you.{" "}
      </p>

      <h2>Rule # 3</h2>
      <h3>No default BDSM mode</h3>
      <p>
        If you’re playing with somebody don’t assume you know what they’re into.
        Not everyone likes to be spanked, choked or getting jizzed on the face.
        I particularly hate the latter!
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 4</h2>
      <h3>Bin your condoms</h3>
      <p>For the love of god...</p>
      <h2>Rule # 5</h2>
      <h3>Stealthing</h3>
      <p>
        This one hardly needs mentioning but better say it and not need it than
        the opposite. Anyone caught removing their johnny without their partner
        knowing will be decapitated. Also, do remember to change condoms every
        time a penis or toy goes from one body to another.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 6</h2>
      <h3>No Piggybacking</h3>
      <p>
        If you see two or more people having sex don’t just jump in. It’s really
        awkward to have to shoo someone away. If you are not a regular play
        partner with whoever is in the scrum wait to be invited in.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 7</h2>
      <h3>Give space</h3>
      <p>
        If you see two or more people having sex don’t invade their space by
        staring too closely. Like the no piggybacking rule, it's awkward to have
        to shoo someone away. You can respectfully look at people have fun but
        give them plenty of space or you'll get asked to back off.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 8</h2>
      <h3>No squirting</h3>
      <p>
        All you plumbers out there, there are way too many people for this. No
        need to show off. We know you are familiar with the female anatomy but
        nobody wants to be finding a free surface and then have to sit on a wet
        patch.
      </p>
      <h2>Rule # 9</h2>
      <h3>No drinks, chewing gum, shoes, phones in the play areas</h3>
      <p>Your things will be waiting for you when you come out.</p>
      <h2>Rule # 10</h2>
      <h3>Don't get too drunk</h3>
      <p>If you're not sober enough you won't be let into the play areas.</p>
      <h2>Rule # 11</h2>
      <h3>
        No DMs to anybody in the what's app chat until you asked them in the
        chat first
      </h3>
      <p>
        Girls especially can get inundated with unwanted messages. Just ask in
        the chat if you can message them privately.
