      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">The orgy room</h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        At the immense 'Wet' party in March, we came up with an idea for a
        proper orgy room.
        <br />
        What newbies usually imagine when they first attend a play party, is a
        big orgy where everybody gets involved with one another, getting lost in
        a sea of limbs. That actually rarely happens. What newbies are likely to
        see is a bunch of couples or, occasionally, threesomes and moresomes
        playing alongside one another. Whilst a lot of people are only
        interested in playing with the person they are with at the time, many
        would, in fact, very much like to get lost in a love puddle.
        <br />
        So we came up with the idea of changing the rules for one of the rooms.
        This room has the same exact rules as the other play rooms (the monitor
        on the night will repeat them to you before going in), except that
        whilst you are not to interrupt somebody playing in the other play
        rooms, in the orgy room you are actively enouraged to ask people to join
        in with them. Consent, of course, still applies, but the idea is that
        you go into this room with the openness to the possibly of getting
        involved with other couples or individuals.

      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">DJs</h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        The music at the tribe has always been carefully curated but in the last
        year we have begun getting DJs and this has been adding massively to the
        fun. We have some serious talent for the upcoming party on june 8th. Two
        well established DJs and a talented upstart, playing sexy, deep house
        (our hatred of raggeaton stronger than ever) from 10am 'til 4am.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">Sauna</h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        We had been talking about a jaunt to Rio's naturist sauna in Kentish
        town for a long time and we finally decided that it was time to do it.
        <br />
        This is gonna happen in mid May. Date to be confirmed.
        <br />
        As the venue will experience a marked spike in good looks, we will ask
        to be paid in order to grace them with our presence. They will tell us,
        rightly, to fuck right off, at which point we will counteroffer by
        trying to wrangle some sort of group discount but will probably not get
        it either and will be asked to leave. We will then apologise for our
        arrogance and beg them to let us in.{" "}
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">July party</h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        We thought that with the hopefully not abysmally shit summer, we may be
        able to enjoy the Tribe garden and have a day party instead. This will,
        of course, run into the early hours of the following morning. We would
        give this a festivally feel, so please, dress accordingly.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">Photos</h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        Photos and videos are no longer allowed. As the group is getting bigger
        and we have new people we decided it's important to only leave image
        capturing in the hands of the official professionals. There will be a
        photographer taking snaps in a designated area, making sure only the
        consenting participants are in the shot.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-center text-muted mb-5">Monitors</h2>
      <p className="text-center text-muted mb-5">
        We now have two paid monitors at the door and at the playrooms. They are
        there to give out wristbands for the sexual health tests, enforce the
        rules and make sure everybody is safe and happy. They won't let anybody
        in the rooms who is too intoxicated, will keep the female/male ratio
        balanced, etc.
      </p>
