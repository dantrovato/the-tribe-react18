        A guide to male multiple orgasms
      </h2>
      <p className="text-muted mb-5">
        A few years ago I heard about a sexual practice involving semen
        retention which may or may not have its roots in the tantric tradition
        (I should probably look it up but can’t be bothered). My understanding
        was that while orgasm and ejaculation happen at the same time they are
        separate events, and by squeezing the gooch (perineum) muscles at the
        point of climax, one can achieve orgasm while preventing semen from
        leaving your body. <br /> “Why on earth would you want to do that?” you
        may ask. Well, one reason would be shorter refractory time; a few
        minutes and you’re good to go again. It’s a bit like the orgasms you
        achieved when you were pre-pubescent; when you used to wank to your
        heart’s content and no mess was ever made. Remember when you used to set
        the alarm for two hours before you had to get up for school and rip the
        head off it as if it owed you money? You used to knock eight or nine out
        before your parents came to “wake you up”. It may have just been me but
        the point is that, as a grown up male, it’s ejaculation, and not orgasm,
        that leaves us knackered. <br /> <br />A second reason is that there is
        evidence that, whilst sex increases our testosterone levels, ejaculation
        actually crashes it. One way to naturally increase testosterone levels,
        according to Dr Andrew Huberman among others, is to have sex but not
        finish. Essentially pulling out before orgasm. That goes against my
        principles. Also, in the immortal words of Billy Connolly, “At the point
        of ejaculation there is no herd of horses that could get my arse go in
        the other direction”. <br /> The benefits of semen retention for the
        purpose of testosterone increase seem to peak at about one week, after
        which time they remain constant. So ejaculating just once a week would
        seem optimal for your testosterone levels. Well that doesn’t sound fun.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        Chances are you, like me, are a bit of a sex monkey, and have
        “commitments” to fulfil. When I first experimented with the squeezing of
        the gooch, I found that it ruined my orgasm whilst only slightly
        reducing the amount of sperm coming out of me. I quickly abandoned the
        esoteric technique and dismissed it as almost unachievable and
        unrealistic, the sexual equivalent of “get rich by watching this video
        on drop shipping”. <br /> <br />A couple of months prior to writing this
        badly cobbled together stream of consciousness, I started thinking about
        it again and found some videos that gave me hope. Particularly one that
        suggested a hack. This technique involved using your hands to squeeze
        the perineum, and seemed much simpler than the hands-free version. I
        thought I’d give it another go. So over the next few weeks I
        experimented with it, alone or in good company, and found exactly what
        works for me. Initially I ruined a few orgasms by pressing on the wrong
        bits. Other times I just wasn’t able to stop jizz coming out by other
        not pressing hard enough or pressing on the wrong parts. <br /> One of
        my first mistakes was placing my fingers too far away from my anus. What
        I found works for me best is to put my middle finger just above my
        arsehole, where my prostate is, and the index finger just above that.
        Then at the point of orgasm I squeeze pretty hard on the prostate. That
        actually, massively INCREASES the intensity of my orgasm whilst
        completely preventing any semen from coming out. It’s a great dry
        sneeze. You take a short break and you can do this over and over again.
        It’s mind-boggling. <br /> <br />I have been doing this ever since and
        now only ejaculate once a week. When that happens you may want to have a
        towel handy. But it’s been fascinating to see how much more sex I have
        been able to have. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to increase
        their sexual power naturally. I’m still experimenting with this and will
        probably tweak this blog as the weeks go on. Anyways, if you do decide
        to give it a go lemme know how you get on. Ok, get out.
