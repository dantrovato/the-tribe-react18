        Welcome to the Tribe, a fast-growing sex positive community of hot and
        fun people who are just amazing vibes.
        <br />
        We run exclusive, invite-only parties of around ninety hand picked
        guests. We also host monthly socials about ten or so days before the
        main event so that newbies can get to know each other and make friends
        ahead of the party.
        <br />
        We also have a single girls chat for any lady who is new to the scene
        who might feel intimidated coming on their own. There, you can ask
        questions to the girls who have been before, go for pre-drinks and come
        to the event later as a group.
        <br />
        The Tribe is a fantastic space to meet like-minded individuals who are
        beautiful inside and out, easy going, open, and not non-judgemental.
        <br />
        The community is precious to us and we are always looking for kindred
        spirits.
        <br />
        Get in touch if you think you'll fit in. We are excited to getting to
        know you!
