        Welcome to the Tribe. We are a community of well over 100 kinksters,
        mostly in their 20's 30's, who meet regularly for fun. The big parties
        happen every three or four months but we have smaller ones which focus
        on introducing newbies to the group. This is s great space to meet like
        minded individuals who take good care of their body and really spark
        joy. The community is precious to us so parties are mostly on an invite
        only or recommendation basis, but once you're in you're not gonna want
        to leave. So get in touch if you think you'll fit in and we look forward
        to meet you :)
      </p>
