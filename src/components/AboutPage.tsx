        Welcome to the Tribe, a community of hot and fun kinksters. We host
        invites only parties of 100 or so guests every three months but we do
        smaller ones which focus on introducing newbies to the group. This is a
        great space to meet like minded individuals who take good care of their
        body and really spark joy. The community is precious to us so guests are
        carefully selected but once you're in you're not gonna want to leave. So
        get in touch if you think you'll fit in and we look forward to getting
        to know you. x
