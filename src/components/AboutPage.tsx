        Welcome to the Tribe, a fast-growing sex positive community of hot and
        fun people who are just amazing vibes. It’s a fantastic space to meet
        like-minded individuals who are beautiful inside and out, easy going,
        open, and not non-judgemental.
        <br />
        <br />
        We run exclusive, invite-only parties of around ninety hand picked
        guests. We also host monthly socials where you can get to know each
        other and make friends before attending a party.

        Single girl and feeling a little nervous? We have a separate girls-only
        chat group – a safe, welcoming space to connect with others who are new
        or flying solo. Here, you can chat, ask questions to experienced Tribe
        girls, and even plan meet-ups before the party.
        <br />
        <br />
        The community is precious to us and we are always looking for kindred
        spirits. Get in touch if you think you'll fit in. We are excited to get
        to know you!
