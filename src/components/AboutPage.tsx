        Welcome to the Tribe, a community of hot kinksters in their 20's 30's.
        We host invites only parties of 100 or so guests every three months but
        we do smaller ones which focus on introducing newbies to the group. This
        is s great space to meet like minded individuals who take good care of
        their body and really spark joy. The community is precious to us so
        guests are carefully selected. It's not an easy place to be invited to
        but once you're in you're not gonna want to leave. So get in touch if
        you think you'll fit in and we look forward to getting to know you. x
