        What tends to describe members of our community best is a confluence of
        attractive qualities such as good looks, positive vibes and a desire to
        connect. We don't vibe with people who get fashionably offended. We
        prefer playmates who assume that most people have good intentions and,
        in the rare instance of silly drama, we assume misunderstanding over
        malevolence (one time - don't take the piss). People are voted in based
        on those traits. We don't want the Tribe to feel like a place where
        people have to walk on eggshells. Our network of friendships makes our
        events perhaps more wholesome than some with a more transactional
        variety.

        Guests at our parties are strongly encouraged to do a sexual health
        check up before attending. As far as we are aware we were the ones to
        start this practice. We know of other groups who have thankfully
        embraced this tradition but the vast majority of parties still haven't.
        This, in our view, makes us The Safe Space. In the summer of 2023 we
        introduced the Wristband System where wristbands of a variety of colours
        indicate how recently one got a complete negative sexual health result.
        This offers peace of mind and encourages people to openly discuss their
        sexual health and recent sexual history.

        We are a mix of new and experienced kindred spirits who are there to
        guide one another in this crazy social experiment. We like for our
        people to look beyond sex; Don't see sex as the main reason to come to
        the party. Look for connections. Sex is the bi product. <br /> <br />
        Boobs rule!
