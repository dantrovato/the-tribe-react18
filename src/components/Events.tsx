          This is a gathering of the hottest new people in the scene or just new
          to the tribe. It's a smaller and more intimate and relaxed party and
          it's a less hectic introduction into our community. Register your

          This one is mega. Starting earlier in the day we will have a band
          provisionally named 'The beauty and the sons of a bitch'and a bunch of
          DJs playing in the garden. The garden, as always, featuring the
          massive fire pit, hot tub, 4 play rooms and a chill out area. Aiming
          at around 100 people, this is probably one of the bigger ones ever.
          Tickets Â£20.{" "}
